# Playground

I hate constantly running `react-native init` to test something. Also I hate keeping an untracked react-native Project to test the Packages I'm working on.

This is now my playground for everything.

## Scripts

### Bend to experiment with directory `[directory-name]`

```
$ npm run bend [directory-name]
```

### Bend to default

```
$ npm run unbend
```

### Create a new experiment

```
$ npm run new [experiment-name]
```


## kthxbye
